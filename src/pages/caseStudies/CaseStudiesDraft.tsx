//           The National Information Technology Authority, Uganda (NITA-U),
//           conducted its first-ever data protection investigation into the
//           operations of Guinness Transporters Limited, trading as SafeBoda. The
//           investigation revealed that SafeBoda had been sharing people’s
//           personal data with third parties without their knowledge and consent,
//           which is a violation of fundamental data protection principles. As a
//           result, NITA-U has ordered SafeBoda to make fundamental reforms
//           regarding the sharing of people’s personal data with third parties.
//         </p>
//         <p>
//           Specifically, SafeBoda has been instructed to amend its privacy
//           notices by the end of May 2021 to provide people with specific and
//           informed consent. This includes clearly informing its customers of the
//           third parties it may disclose their personal data to, in accordance
//           with the principle of fairness under section 3 (1) (b) of the Data
//           Protection and Privacy Act, 2019. NITA-U also requires SafeBoda to
//           specify safeguards in place for cross-border transfer of personal
//           data. The regulator’s report is a result of an early 2020
//           investigation into SafeBoda’s non-compliance with the Data Protection
//           and Privacy Act, 2019.

//           lender was mining their phone contacts and sending them unsolicited

//           This article from Bowmans discusses a decision issued by the High
//           Court of Kenya regarding the violation of the right to privacy in the
//           context of domestic CCTV systems.
//         </p>
//         <p>
//           “On May 31, 2023, in the case of Ondieki v. Maeda (Petition E153 of
//           2022), the High Court allowed a petition on violation of the
//           constitutional right to privacy in the context of the installation of
//           CCTV cameras in a residential area. The respondent, Ondieki, had
//           installed CCTV cameras on her premises for security purposes. The
//           petitioner, Maeda, who is the adjacent neighbor of the respondent,
//           lodged a petition claiming that the CCTV camera installation was done
//           in a manner that breached his right to privacy. The petitioner stated
//           that the cameras were positioned in a manner that could spy, monitor,
//           and record the images of his property and individuals on it.
//         </p>
//         <p>
//           The High Court stated that, as per the Kenyan Data Protection Act
//           (DPA), the respondent was deemed a data controller processing personal
//           data through her CCTV of the petitioner as a data subject. Based on
//           this view of the respondent being a data controller, the High Court
//           held that the respondent was required to be registered with the Data
//           Commissioner and to have sought the petitioner’s consent to collect
//           data through the CCTV cameras.
//         </p>
//         <p>
//           Ultimately, the High Court, in allowing the claim, made a declaratory
//           order that the actions of the respondent violated the petitioner’s
//           rights under Article 31 of the Constitution and his rights as a data
//           subject under the DPA.”

//           The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC) in Kenya issued
//           its first penalty against OPPO Kenya on December 21, 2022. The
//           penalty, amounting to KES 5 million (USD 40,600), was imposed due to
//           OPPO Kenya's failure to comply with an enforcement notice.
//         </p>
//         <p>
//           The enforcement notice was issued after OPPO Kenya infringed on a
//           complainant's privacy by using their photo on the company's Instagram
//           account without the complainant's consent. Despite the enforcement
//           notice, OPPO Kenya failed to develop a policy in compliance with

//           personal data should not be used for commercial purposes unless
//           consent has been obtained from the data subject or as permitted under
